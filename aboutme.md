Hello! My name is Claire. I am a 4th year computer science student at the University of Texas at Austin. I do [research](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huth/) and also work as a data scientist at a pathology lab in Austin. In my free time I like to do weightlifting, community service, and volunteer to teach kids how to code.
